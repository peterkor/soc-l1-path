# [Your Name] –  SOC / Blue Team Analyst

I am an IT professional with 15+ years of experience in software development and integration, now focusing on a career as a  SOC / Blue Team analyst.  
This portfolio documents my hands‑on labs (TryHackMe, Splunk) and my journey toward a SOC role in 2026.

## Certifications and Background

- 15+ years in IT (software development, integration)  
- Currently in 15% of the **SOC Level 1 path** on TryHackMe, aiming for **Security Analyst Level 1 (SAL1)** certification.

## Focus areas

- Log analysis (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, firewall, proxy logs)
- SIEM: Splunk – basics of architecture, data ingestion, and SPL queries (stats, timechart, dedup, where, eval)
- Alert triage and incident handling (SOC Level 1 – TryHackMe)
- Basic network forensics and cross‑source log correlation

## SOC Level 1 Path – Progress

I am currently in 15% of the SOC Level 1 path. I will document each module as I complete it.  
See the full path: [SOC Level 1 on TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/careers/cyber-security-analyst).

## Splunk Deep‑Dive

I will document Splunk‑specific rooms after completing the SOC Level 1 path or in parallel when relevant.
