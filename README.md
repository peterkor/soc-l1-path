# Peter Korman – Junior SOC / Blue Team Analyst

I am an IT professional with 15+ years of experience in software development and integration, now focusing on a career as a Junior SOC / Blue Team analyst.  
This portfolio documents my hands‑on labs (TryHackMe, Splunk) and my journey toward a SOC role.

## Focus areas

- Log analysis (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, firewall, proxy logs)
- SIEM: Splunk – basics of architecture, data ingestion, and SPL queries (stats, timechart, dedup, where, eval)
- Alert triage and incident handling (SOC Level 1 – TryHackMe)
- Basic network forensics and cross‑source log correlation

## SOC Level 1 Path

*(I am currently in 15% of the SOC Level 1 path. I will document each module as I complete it.)*

## Splunk Deep‑Dive

*(I will document Splunk‑specific rooms after completing the SOC Level 1 path or in parallel when relevant.)*
