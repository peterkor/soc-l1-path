### Case Study: [short incident name]

**Environment:** TryHackMe – [room], Splunk with logs from [e.g., Sysmon + Suricata + firewall]  

**Incident description:**  
2–3 sentences: what happened (e.g., multi‑stage attack, brute‑force, web defacement).

**Detection:**  
- How the incident was detected (alert, log pattern, anomaly in a time series).
- Which index / sourcetype you used as a starting point.

**SPL queries used (selected examples):**  
- Brief description + query (you can shorten parts, but keep the logic clear).

**Findings:**  
- What the attacker did (timeline, IPs, accounts, machines).

**Recommendations:**  
- 3–5 bullet points: what should be done in a real SOC (rules, alerts, hardening).
