### [Room Name]

**Platform:** TryHackMe – [room link]  
**Area:** [SIEM / SOC Level 1 / log analysis / incident handling]  

**Goal:**  
Briefly describe what you learned in this lab (e.g., Splunk basics, filtering logs, hunting for brute‑force attempts, working with the BOTS dataset).

**Tools / technologies used:**  
- Splunk (SPL queries: stats, timechart, dedup, where, eval, etc.)
- Log types: VPN / firewall / Sysmon / Suricata (as applicable)

**What I did:**  
- Short bullets: scenario, what you were looking for, what queries you wrote.
- You can include 1–2 anonymized SPL queries as examples.

**What I learned for SOC work:**  
- 2–4 concrete takeaways (e.g., “how to spot brute‑force from a timechart”, “how to correlate multiple log sources”).
